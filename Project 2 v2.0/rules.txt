HELLO
Welcome to MINESWEEPER version 2.0 programmed by Christopher Alexman
Here is how to play:

You will have to make a choice between the beginner, intermediate, and expert options.
Be warned, it will not be easy.
Once one is selected a grid will be displayed to the specifications of your choice.
You will then be asked this ---> "Enter row [space] column: "
On your keyboard enter the row you wish and the column you wish.
This will uncover one of the spots on the board and one of three things will happen.
1. A mine ( '*' ) will show up and you will lose, immediately.
2. A blank space ( ' ' ) will show up and you will be asked for another row/column.
3. A number ( '1 through 8 ' ) will show up, giving you a clue.

The goal is to avoid the mines and discover all of the spots on the grid that are 
not mines. To do this use the hint. The numbers 1-8 that will show up will tell you
how many of the 8 spots surrounding your selected spot are mines.

The first row/column selection is a hit or miss for mines or not. Just try it and
have fun. Good luck!
